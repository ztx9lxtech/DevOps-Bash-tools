usage_description="
Launches local AWS SSO authentication pop-up (if not already authenticated)

Then scp's the latest resultant ~/.aws/sso/cache/ file to the remote server

And SSH's there so that you can use AWS CLI or kubectl to EKS remotely on that server easily,
without having to copy and paste the token from remote aws sso login to your local web browser

Useful in enviroments where only a bastion server can access EKS clusters or other AWS services

Since all args go to AWS CLI, if you need to pass SSH options use the environment variable SSH_OPTIONS eg:

    export SSH_OPTIONS=\"-i $HOME/.ssh/aws.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no\"

Best used when combined with automatically configuring your environment variables for the AWS_PROFILE etc.
using direnv or similar

For code on how to do that, see:
